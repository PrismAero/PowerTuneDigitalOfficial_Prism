Complete Phase 1-3: UDP receiver modularization and QML migration

Phase 1 - UDP Receiver Modularization:
- Rewrote UDPReceiver.h to use domain model pointers instead of Dashboard
- Updated UDPReceiver.cpp constructor and processPendingDatagrams to route
  data directly to EngineData, VehicleData, GPSData, AnalogInputs,
  DigitalInputs, ExpanderBoardData, ElectricMotorData, FlagsData,
  SensorData, ConnectionData, SettingsData, and TimingData models
- Updated Connect class to pass all model pointers to UDPReceiver

Phase 2 - Verification:
- Verified all 200+ UDP switch cases correctly mapped to domain models
- Confirmed successful compilation with new architecture

Phase 3 - QML Migration:
- Created PropertyRouter class for dynamic QML property access
  (replaces Dashboard[propertyName] pattern with PropertyRouter.getValue())
- Migrated 53 QML files from Dashboard.xxx to domain models:
  - Dashboard.language -> Settings.language
  - Dashboard.speedunits -> Settings.speedunits  
  - Dashboard.rpm -> Engine.rpm
  - Dashboard.speed -> Vehicle.speed
  - Dashboard.draggable -> UI.draggable
  - And 700+ other property references
- Extended UIState with dashsetup1-3, backroundpictures, maindashsetup, dashfiles
- Extended ConnectionData with externalspeedconnectionrequest, externalspeedport, musicpath
- All active Dashboard.xxx references in QML now use appropriate domain models

Files modified: 64 QML files, UDPReceiver, Connect, UIState, ConnectionData
New files: PropertyRouter.h/cpp, Core/Models/*
